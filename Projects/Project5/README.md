# MY PROJECT 5

## FILES CREATED AND MODIFIED
- for the /etc/hosts file, I did not create one, but modified the one that already exists on all of the systems. To configure this to I used the info provided from [How to Edit Your Hosts File on Linux, Windows, and macOS](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/), which explained that the /etc/hosts file is used to map specified domain to an ip address. And it is configured like this:
    - IPADRESS DomainName [DomainAlias]
